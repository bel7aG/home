Airports, however, have remained stagnant. Over the years one of the main challenges they have faced in their pursuit of an easy streamlined business model is baggage handling.When considering current airport capacity in addition to the projected growth in passenger traffic the problem is two-fold.Global passenger traffic is expected to double by 2036 and the most common reason for airport bottlenecks and delays are capacity issues in their baggage halls.And this doesn\u2019t only create a stressful, frustrating experience for passengers, but it also costs airports and airlines dearly. Our mission at bob.io is to reunite great minds with different backgrounds around a topic that obsesses us, improving passengers\u2019 experience. And in the wake of our customer centered solution we are solving an incipient capacity issue at airports.Now, momentum is building for alternatives to the airport counter, at bob.io we are devoted to creating a tech-enabled service where passengers can check-in their luggage from their doorstep. As alternative methods to traditional check-in become mainstream, all signs seem to point that passenger\u2019s desire for convenience and airports\u2019 need for extra capacity could eventually do away with the standard.",

With over 1.4 million men and women on active duty, and 718,000 civilian personnel, we are the nation's largest employer. Another 1.1 million serve in the National Guard and Reserve forces. More than 2 million military retirees and their family members receive benefits.Headquarters of the Department of Defense, the Pentagon is one of the world's largest office buildings. It is twice the size of the Merchandise Mart in Chicago, and has three times the floor space of the Empire State Building in New York. Built during the early years of World War II, it is still thought of as one of the most efficient office buildings in the world. Despite 17.5 miles of corridors it takes only seven minutes to walk between any two points in the building.The national security depends on our defense installations and facilities being in the right place, at the right time, with the right qualities and capacities to protect our national resources. Those resources have never been more important as America fights terrorists who plan and carry out attacks on our facilities and our people. Our military servicemembers and civilians operate in every time zone and in every climate. More than 450,000 employees are overseas, both afloat and ashore.The Defense Department manages an inventory of installations and facilities to keep Americans safe. The Department's physical plant is huge by any standard, consisting of more than several hundred thousand individual buildings and structures located at more than 5,000 different locations or sites. When all sites are added together, the Department of Defense utilizes over 30 million acres of land.These sites range from the very small in size such as unoccupied sites supporting a single navigational aid that sit on less than one-half acre, to the Army's vast White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico with over 3.6 million acres, or the Navy's large complex of installations at Norfolk, Virginia with more than 78,000 employees.MissionThe mission of the Department of Defense is to provide the military forces needed to deter war and to protect the security of our country. The department's headquarters is at the Pentagon.The mission of Defense.gov is to support the overall mission of the Department of Defense by providing official, timely and accurate information about defense policies, organizations, functions and operations. Also, Defense.gov is the single, unified starting point for finding military information online.This mission is consistent with the DoD Principles of Information, which outline the Department's policy for providing information to military members, DoD civilians, military family members, the American public, the Congress, and the news media.

The company helps retailers enhance their customer experience by giving customers the choice to receive their items whenever and wherever they want. Deliv allows retailers to offer their customers a same-day delivery option as they shop from their website, mobile app or even when they are shopping in their physical brick and mortar stores. The same-day delivery button is simply added into the existing checkout process which allows the retailer to maintain ownership and data from each customer transaction. All same-day delivery orders (whether purchased online or in the store) are fulfilled and delivered from local brick and mortar stores, which now allow retailers\u2019 stores to strategically become local distribution centers. This allows retailers to deliver faster and cheaper and in a more convenient way than any pure play eCommerce player like Amazon. Deliv has partnered with nearly 100 national and regional omnichannel retailers, as well as the four largest mall operators in the U.S., Simon Property Group, Macerich, Westfield and General Growth Properties. These mall operators manage close to 800 malls across the country, and extend this offering to all of its tenant retailers. Deliv is currently live with almost 100 retailers in nine malls across the four mall operators in five geographies within California and Illinois. Deliv is quickly expanding to dozens of other geographies nationwide. Deliv\u2019s crowdsourced drivers are made up of highly educated, experienced customer service and sales personnel. They are rated by customers so the platform is able to prioritize the allocation of jobs to those with the highest ratings. The Deliv platform incorporates smart routing and full transparency including the ability for shoppers to watch their delivery on a map real time from pickup to delivery to their doorstep. To date, Deliv has raised $12.5 million from traditional, institutional and strategic investors including the four mall operators, Simon, Macerich, Westfield and GGP, as well as General Catalyst Partners, Operators Fund, PivotNorth Capital, RPM Ventures and Upfront Ventures.",

BEAD analysis learns from the building and its users and is empowered to start taking over the most intelligent operation of the building. The building will not only be a smart building but also a building operated by artificial intelligence based on ever-improving, anonymised data. It controls automation and redirects energy to be used where and when it is needed. Its logic builds on the idea that buildings are dynamic entities and should be treated more like living and learning organisms and not like static dumb assets. Today, they give the opportunity to commercial buildings owners who don't know how they consume energy to connect with the buildings life cycle in order to save energy and cost while getting the same level of quality as up to now via operating the buildings with BEADs' AI. With the help of BEAD the buildings will have a smart energy agent that works and operates the building 7/24. BEAD furthermore analyses how commercial buildings consume energy according to human behavior, occupancy ratios and ambiance and environmental changes in the building in order to give real-time feedback to the automation system.

Their journey began with the vision to design and build an anti-fraud technology that could help create a fraud-free world \u2014 one where e-commerce merchants would never have to worry about managing risk again. They found that all existing anti-fraud solutions were built on outdated technologies, insufficient for dealing with sophisticated cyber criminals. Existing rule-based systems,\u00a0as well as classic machine learning solutions, are expensive and slow to adapt to new fraud patterns in real-time. Their team of intelligence and payment experts spent the last several years designing a proprietary technology from scratch. The result is an advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that not only eliminates payment fraud but also maximizes revenues by reducing false positives. Fraugster has been operating around the world since 2016 and is currently responsible for tens of billions of dollars in annual payment volumes.",

It\u2019s a platform, which allows merchants and customers to seamlessly interact and transact, both offline and online (aka Omnichannel). The platform has been built on the basis of two major growing industry trends: 1. The shift from legacy Point of Sales (POS) systems to cloud based Tablet solutions 2. The demand for various PreOrdering services by consumers, such as delivery, PreOrder, Reservations and @Table. Within minutes a merchant can get started using Zash, setting up a free online account through the Zash website, downloading a free iPad Zash POS app (for Merchants) which allows them to operate their business end to end. In addition the merchants have access to the Zash Order app (service for Customers), further enhancing the value proposition. The Zash POS can function irrespectively if a customer has the Zash Order app or not. The POS industry is well established and the majority of merchants have some form of POS system enabled today. However most current POS systems are built on legacy IT systems, not being cloud based and requires high hardware investments, legacy POS systems also does not integrate with customer services. It is this specific interconnected service that sets Zash part from the rest of the competition in its current form. With Zash merchants have everything they need, under one umbrella, to a much lower cost than the current fragmented offering in the market. The solution has been developed with the modern merchant and customer in mind, which not only desire convenience in technological solution, but also expect it!",

The classic shower uses a low flow showerhead, and works just like a traditional shower: the water is drained after just one use. The FreshCycles filter, purify and use a water drop about 9 times. They provide high pressure, high volume showers, whilst saving up to 70% on energy and 85% on water. After every session, the e-Shower self-cleans and drains completely, flushing its filters in the process. No filter replacement is necessary. Every next user will have a crystal clear experience. The e-Shower is Wi-Fi connected and equipped with a 7 inch touchscreen, allowing for a wide range of applications for homes, hotels and gyms. It logs all the data, giving insight into the shower behavior of your family and customers. It allows for gamification of the savings, encouraging everyone to save more with the Refresh Cycles. You can also connect a device to your e-Shower to stream music, check your savings, or start your shower.",

It existed independently until the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch in 2008, which formed Anheuser-Busch InBev (abbreviated AB InBev). InBev had operations in over 30 countries and sales in over 130 countries. In 2006, it had a market capitalization of \u20ac30.6 billion and net profit of \u20ac3.2 billion on sales of \u20ac13.3 billion. On July 13, 2008, InBev agreed to buy Anheuser-Busch, forming a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. It was reported that Anheuser would get two seats on the combined board. To obtain antitrust approval in the United States, InBev agreed to divest itself of the company that imported Labatt's beer, another InBev brand, into the United States; this transaction was completed on March 13, 2009.The all-cash agreement, for $70 per share, or almost $52 billion, created the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of Budweiser and Michelob with the producer of Stella Artois, Bass and Brahma. The two companies would have yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the previous largest brewer, London-based SABMiller.On October 10, 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev acquired SABMiller for \u00a369 billion (US$107 billion). SABMiller then ceased trading on global stock markets. The new company, now Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, subsequently sold the MillerCoors beer company to Molson Coors and sold many of the European brands to Asahi Breweries.",

    "description": "The proliferation of digital access has made the world more connected than ever before. Trust is the common thread that connects today\u2019s elastic enterprise--trust that your identity solution will be there when you need it most and trust that your end-users know their information is safe. The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform is the identity foundation to build secure, scalable and smart trusted experiences that connect people with technology. With OneLogin, seamlessly manage digital identities for your workforce and customers, so you can focus on what matters most--growing your business. With OneLogin\u2019s complete solution, you can easily connect all of your applications, leverage our proprietary machine learning to identify and analyze potential threats and act quickly using contextual authentication requirements. Secure: Security is the cornerstone of trust. It\u2019s the confidence that your identity solution is reliable and always-on, so you can focus on what matters--growing the business. The OneLogin platform protects your organization against threats by securing and centralizing your applications, devices, and end-users all in one, easy-to-access place. Additionally, through our advanced machine learning capabilities, OneLogin can deliver real-time threat intelligence to help automate the process of keeping your business secure. Scalable: The OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform was built for performance and reliability at scale. With a wide breadth of extensible functionality, we can expand and retract according to the changing needs of your business. Through our enterprise-grade change management solutions, like our Enterprise Sandbox and API Access, you can quickly test large-scale changes before going live in your production instance. Our high availability Login Clusters elastically load-balance providing reliable, continuous service when you need it the most. That means if your database is impacted for any reason, your OneLogin environment won\u2019t be impacted. Smart: The risk of cyberattacks continue to increase as perpetrators look for smarter and less-detectable ways to circumvent security solutions. And for today\u2019s businesses, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to implement solutions that evolve as the methods of attackers evolve. Although Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) has become the defacto tool to protect end-user credentials and your business\u2019 sensitive data, static authentication simply isn\u2019t enough. Additionally, as identity management solutions seek to find more ways to secure the enterprise, user experience is often sacrificed, causing end-users to become increasingly agitated, often seeking out ways to evade having to authenticate several times. Simple: Ease-of-use and speed-of-adoption are imperative to ensuring your identity and access management strategy is effectively rolled out across your organization. And in order to achieve that the solution you choose must be simple. And that means simple for you and simple for your users. OneLogin has millions of users at more than 2000 organizations in more than 44 countries, including AAA, Airbus, Carlyle Group, Citizen, Evernote, Fastenal, Herman Miller, Pandora, San Jose Unified School District, Steelcase, Stitch Fix, and Uber. Solution highlights: * 100% on-demand * Pre-integrated with 6,000+ apps * Integrates with any web app * Market leading directory integration with LDAP, Active Directory, G Suite, Workday, UltiPro, and Namely * Single sign-on and self-service password administration * Automated user on-boarding and instant off-boarding * Role-based access control * Strong authentication with a mobile one-time password app * Two-factor authentication with OneLogin Protect, Duo, RSA, VASCO, SafeNet, Symantec VIP Access, and Yubico Yubikey * Identity compliance reporting * SAML 1.1/2.0, WS-Federation and OpenID Connect single sign-on * Custom connectors for in-house apps * Open-source SAML toolkits *Developer toolkits & APIs DIFFERENTIATORS: Recent OneLogin differentiating firsts demonstrating the company\u2019s \u201cbridge for authentication across cloud, on-premise, and mobile\u201d include: OneLogin Access: OneLogin Access extends the reach of the OneLogin Trusted Experience Platform\u2122 to applications hosted on-premises and in public or private clouds. We bring the benefits of the cloud to you: simplified administration reduced IT costs, improved security, and enhanced user experience. OneLogin Access eliminates aging Access Management tools that are complex, expensive, and disconnected from modern SaaS environments. Through the OneLogin portal, users enjoy a simple, consistent experience with single-click access to SaaS and on-premise applications from any device. OneLogin SmartFactor AuthenticationTM: As part of our Trusted Experience Platform\u2122, SmartFactor Authentication leverages our Vigilance AI\u2122 risk score to dynamically adjust authentication requirements in real-time based on the level of risk for each login, balancing security with usability. OneLogin\u2019s SmartFactor Authentication uses machine learning to analyze a broad range of inputs, such as location, device, and user behavior, to calculate a risk score and determine the most appropriate security action to take for each login attempt. Depending on the detected level of risk, SmartFactor Authentication adjusts the number of authentication factors needed to log in. OneLogin Desktop: OneLogin Desktop is endpoint management that enrolls a user's laptop or desktop computer with the OneLogin Cloud Directory, and creates a secure profile on their machine that can only be accessed with the company's OneLogin Cloud Directory credentials. Once the user is in their new secure profile, they can access web- and desktop apps as they please, without entering their credentials again. OneLogin Real-Time Active Directory Sync: OneLogin has the industry\u2019s fastest and most secure Active Directory connector. IT administrators can now automate the process of quickly granting and revoking cloud access to the right users at the right time. OneLogin Cloud RADIUS: OneLogin\u2019s support for RADIUS-enabled appliances, such as Merakiwireless network devices, delivers safe, flexible, and reliable authentication for Wireless and VPN with nothing to install on-premise \u2014 an area where other identity management solutions fall short. ACQUISITIONS: In June 2017, OneLogin acquired Auckland, New Zealand-based ThisData, a developer-focused cloud security company specializing in account takeover detection. The technology has been used to enable OneLogin\u2019s adaptive authentication solution, which uses machine learning to intelligently score the risk of each login attempt, and challenges users making high-risk logins to use an additional authentication factor. In November 2016, OneLogin acquired Sphere Secure Workspace, Inc., a software vendor with next-generation mobile container technology. The Sphere technology will be used to extend OneLogin\u2019s endpoint security from desktops to mobile devices and thereby providing a unified endpoint management solution for enterprises. RECOGNITION: In November 2019, OneLogin was named a 2019 Gartner Peer Insights Customers\u2019 Choice for Access Management Software. In September 2019, OneLogin was recognized in the G2 Grid as one of the top four leaders for Single Sign-On (SSO) software. In June 2019, OneLogin achieved a strong performer ranking for identity-as-a-service (IDaaS) in \u201cThe Forrester Wave\u2122: Identity-As-A-Service (IDaaS) For Enterprise, Q2 2019.\u201d In April 2019, OneLogin was named the 2019 G2 Leader and Top Performer in the following categories: Privileged Access Management Single Sign On (SSO) Customer Identity and Access Management User Provisioning/Governance.

Complementing this information with other onboard sensors the UAV always keeps a safe distance from the blade and follows a much more stable and robust path. Importantly this makes the blade inspection a semi-autonomous and robust procedure as it is no longer dependent on pilot expertise and ensures that the UAV does not collide with the blade. This offers unparalleled reliability and operational safety. Furthermore we are continuously improving our control system with the aim of reaching a fully automated inspection. We have selected and integrated a custom payload optimised for the specificity of inspecting a blade. Visual inspections are carried out using an industrial camera to deliver milimetric precision on the blade.

The Pulmonx solution, which is comprised of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve), the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (Chartis System) and the StratX Lung Analysis Platform, is designed to treat severe emphysema patients who, despite medical management, are still profoundly symptomatic and either do not want or are ineligible for surgical approaches. The technology is supported by a compelling body of clinical evidence including over 100 published scientific articles regarding the clinical benefits of Zephyr Valves. FDA granted the Zephyr Valve a \u2018breakthrough device\u2019 designation, and in June 2018 Pulmonx received FDA pre-market approval to commercialize our Zephyr Valve. The Zephyr Valve is now commercially available and physicians in more than 25 countries around the world routinely use the Zephyr Valves to improve the lives of patients with severe emphysema, with over 76,000 valves used to treat more than 19,000 patients worldwide to date.",

So we joined forces with agents who wanted to be customer advocates, not salesmen. Since these were our own agents, we could survey each customer on our service and pay a bonus based on the review. We deepened our technology beyond the initial search to make the home tour, the listing debut, the escrow process, the whole process, faster, easier and worry-free. And we gave customers more value, not just by saving each thousands in fees, but by investing in every home we sell, by measuring our performance and improving constantly.

    "description": "released by ITU, the UN agency for information and communication technologies, shows that 80% of young people now use the internet, and this number is only set to increase as more and more of the developing world comes online in the coming decade. More than half the world\u2019s population is predicted to not only be online by 2020, but to be using a mobile device as their primary method of accessing the internet. That\u2019s a lot of mobile devices enabling the real-time exchange of information between people. When you add all this together, it seems counter-intuitive that the closest industry we have to trying to understand how real people engage with the world around them is an incumbent $40B a year research market that is still dominated by large network agencies, static surveys and cold calling. We all instinctively know that human behaviour is too complex to standardise and understand with multiple-choice questions and automated analysis, but this is what most research groups still offer today. International companies need deep insight into unique drivers of human behaviour to be able to understand their customers and grow into new markets. Which is why we are proud to today announce our Series A investment into Led by co-founders Tugce Bulut (CEO) and Oliver May (CCO), Streetbees is a London-based global intelligence platform that reveals how people behave, and why, by analysing real-life moments collected from its worldwide users on an always-on basis. With Streetbees, we have found the world\u2019s first real-time technology-enabled customer insights platform \u2013 giving companies dynamic responses, from real customers, for a fraction of the cost and time taken by traditional incumbents. Streetbees has fundamentally changed the way international companies can engage and understand their global consumer base enabled by mobile technology, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning which enable it to extract insight from unstructured data (via pictures, video, chat) . We have been incredibly impressed by Tugce and Oliver\u2019s bold vision and dedicated leadership, which has grown the Streetbees community to over 1 million users \u2013 or \u2018bees\u2019 \u2013 across 150 countries worldwide, who are actively responding using the chat-style Streetbees app to share moments from their daily lives. Giving as much, or as little, information as they like. By applying advanced natural language processing technology to the results, Streetbees uncovers not just what they do, but also why they do it, and what drives them \u2013 and predicts what they may do next. This allows Streetbees\u2019 customers \u2013 who include Unilever, PepsiCo, BBC World Service, Vodafone and L\u2019Oreal among others \u2013 to receive rich insights into communities anywhere in the world at an unprecedented scale and affordable cost, helping them deeply understand new or unfamiliar markets. Using the Streetbees platform, world-leading companies are able to make more informed and accurate decisions about consumer behaviour, and predict future trends with confidence. With this new funding, Streetbees will further develop its machine learning technology platform to provide customers with a live stream of information from its users that is constantly being collected across the world. The new platform, called Always On, allows customers to have ongoing access to insights from real-life stories, instead of relying on one-shot multiple-choice surveys to try and understand communities and markets. Already, we have witnessed first-hand the results from the platform that have identified surprising trends that have gone unspotted elsewhere. The funding will also allow Streetbees, which currently employs 75 people in London and Lisbon, to expand its data science team, develop its community networks across the world, and grow in the US, where the company opened an office in January 2018. Streetbees\u2019 mission is to make human data accessible, anywhere in the world. By providing better information that contains real insight into how people behave, the company hopes to make data collection mutually beneficial for companies and global communities by facilitating economic development in areas that have previously been under-served due to lack of market intelligence and visibility.

Using a systems engineering approach, Tevva has developed world-class electric vehicle technology that adheres to the most rigorous of standards to ensure safety, reliability and durability. Tevva\u2019s core proprietary technologies \u2013 comprising battery pack and management system, control system, software and optional range extender \u2013 are applicable to almost any current 7.5t \u2013 14t truck and is supplied as a package to OEMs for integration with their vehicles. In order to support the development of the technology and demonstrate the cost savings possible by their use, Tevva is working with a cohort of early customers to produce a fleet of rental vehicles for use by logistics companies. The four technology pillars offered by the company, which can be used either together or individually, comprise the following: \u2022 Tevva Power \u2013 Battery packs, bespoke battery management system and power control system that regulates the flow of energy from and to the batteries \u2022 Tevva Link \u2013 cloud-based software that controls, links and optimises all of the onboard technologies including autonomous engagement of the range extender and also offers performance diagnostics \u2022 Tevva Drive \u2013 drive system that delivers greater control of torque delivery and utilises the efficiency of regenerative braking to harvest energy that goes back into the battery system \u2022 Tevva ReX \u2013 optional range extender that offers more flexible functionality and eliminates range anxiety The range extender and patented, cloud-based Predictive Range Extender Management System (PREMS) ensures that the vehicle always completes its duty cycle and that daily energy usage is optimised whilst also lowering total cost of ownership and minimising emissions. The standard 150kWh Tevva electric motor produces 2,000Nm of torque and delivers a range of around 120km a day, based on typical urban distribution duty cycle. For back-to-base distribution businesses with out-of-town depots, the range extender and PREMS system not only ensure that range anxiety is eliminated but also uses geofencing technology to autonomously engage pure electric or range extender mode depending on whether or not the vehicle is in urban or Clean Air Zones. Early series production is underway and manufacture upscaling is proceeding. For more background on Tevva\u2019s growth see https://tevva.com/growth-timeline/.

Ubiquitous in everyday objects and in human homes for millennia, wood is an essential material, a familiar symbol of the symbiosis between man and nature. But it has many limitations: in addition to being vulnerable to fire and insect attack, it has limited structural strength and complete opacity that limits its scope of use. Woodoo removes all these limitations by reconstructing the internal structure of the wood at the molecular level. Wood is indeed a porous matrix of cellulose and binding elements (lignin, hemicellulose, etc.) that can contain 50 to 90% of air depending on the species of wood. Thanks to an innovative and patented process, Woodoo manages to release the internal matrix of the wood while reinforcing it with natural compounds that have the property of creating much stronger anatomical bonds between the native fibers of the wood. Due to its exceptional properties, this hybrid wood material opens up entirely new possibilities in the field of design and construction. The production of translucent wood will also contribute to the revitalization of the wood industry in France. Translucent wood, a unique material born of a patented innovation, has four essential qualities that give it comparative advantages: * a unique aesthetic appearance. * high structural performance. * exceptional ecological performance. * a low production cost.",
